Overview
"Cheese and Eagle Game" is a simple web-based sprite animation game where a dog character can move left, right, walk, and run. Additionally, cheese and eagle sprites randomly fall from the top of the canvas, adding dynamic elements to the game.
Collected cheese will grant 1 point, whereas an eagle touching the dog will cause a game over.
